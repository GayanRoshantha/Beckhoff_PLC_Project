<h1 align="center  Project:		Automation System Re-Design (Framing Machine & Tables)</h1>
Client:		OZ BUILD CONSTRUCTIONS
#INTRODUCTION:
#The current setup is entirely automated and controlled by a centralized PLC. It comprises a Framing station with two nailing stations, and six panel tables. The system comprises Beckhoff PLC and I/O modules, along with a centralized HMI control system. 
The system consists of two main electrical cabinets interconnected via EtherCAT for communication. The primary Beckhoff PLC governs the entire system's operations based on signals received from the HMI. Each panel incorporates I/O modules, safety modules, and power supplies. Communication among the PLC and modules is facilitated by HMI signals and the EtherCAT communication protocol. The PLC program and HMI have been developed using TwinCAT2, an outdated software.
